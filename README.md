<h3>Coliseum</h3>

<strong>A project by Steve Chang.</strong>

August 2013



I made this game after finishing my first computer science course in college. This project taught me a lot about game design
and programming in general. Object-oriented programming was something I was just getting used to at this time and working on
this project really helped me to grasp the idea of it.

Quickstart:

1.  Navigate to the directory the jar file is located.
2.  Open the file using <code>java -jar coliseum.jar</code>.
